# Screen Time

**Screen Time** is a Visual Studio Code extension that displays your active screen time in the status bar. It helps you keep track of how much time you've spent working in VS Code, updating live in the status bar.

## Features

- Displays live screen time in the VS Code status bar.
- Automatically starts and stops tracking based on the window's focus state.
- Displays the total screen time in a human-readable format.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed, the screen time will automatically start tracking when you open VS Code.

- **View Screen Time:** You can view your current screen time in the status bar at the bottom right.
- **Show Screen Time:** Run the command `Show Screen Time` via the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) to display your current screen time as a notification.

The timer updates every second and automatically pauses when you minimize or unfocus the VS Code window. When you return, it resumes tracking.

## Commands

- `Show Screen Time`: Displays the current screen time in a popup message.
